\maketitle

This report was generated automatically by the script, which is located in
the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/yegor256/cam}{yegor256/cam}.

In total, \iexec{tail -n +2 "${TARGET}/repositories.csv" | wc -l}\unskip{} repositories
were found and retrieved from GitHub.
\iexec{cat "${TARGET}/temp/repo-details.tex"}
The full list of them is in the \ff{repositories.csv} file.
The \ff{hashes.csv} file has a list of Git hashes of their latest commits.

The filtering process was the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\iexec{cat "${TARGET}"/temp/reports/*.tex}\unskip{}
\end{enumerate}

The structure of the archive is the following:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \ff{data/} is the collection of \ff{.csv} files with the data
  (\iexec{find "${TARGET}/data" -type f -name '*.csv' | wc -l}\unskip{} total);

  \item \ff{github/} is the entire collection of
  \iexec{find "${TARGET}/github" -type f -name '*.java' | wc -l}\unskip{}
  source files ``as is''
  (\iexec{du -sh "${TARGET}/github" | cut -f1}\unskip{} total).

\end{itemize}

There are \iexec{cat "${TARGET}/temp/list-of-metrics.tex" | wc -l}\unskip{} metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \input{$TARGET/temp/list-of-metrics.tex}
\end{itemize}

The dataset was built by
\iexec{nproc}\unskip{}
CPUs\iexec{"${LOCAL}/help/tdiff.sh" "$(cat "${TARGET}/start.txt")"}\unskip{}.
