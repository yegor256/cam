This report is generated automatically by the script, which you can find in
the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/yegor256/cam}{yegor256/cam}.

We found and retrieved \iexec{cat ../dataset/repositories.csv | wc -l}
repositories from GitHub.
\iexec{cat ../dataset/temp/repo-details.tex}
The full list of them is in the \ff{repositories.csv} file.
The \ff{hashes.csv} file has a list of Git hashes of their latest commits.

\iexec{cat ../dataset/temp/reports/*.tex}

The structure of the archive:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ff{data/} is the collection of \ff{.csv} files with the data
  you are looking for (\iexec{find ../dataset/data -name '*.csv' | wc -l} total);

  \item \ff{github/} is the entire collection of
  \iexec{find ../dataset/github -name '*.java' | wc -l}
  source files ``as is''
  (\iexec{du -sh ../dataset/github | cut -f1} total);

  \item \ff{measurements/} is where we keep individual metrics calculated
  per file, which you may use to verify our algorithms;
\end{itemize}

The metrics we use:

\begin{itemize}
  \input{../dataset/temp/list-of-metrics.tex}
\end{itemize}
